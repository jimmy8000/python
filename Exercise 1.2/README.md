Step 1: Create a new dictionary of recipe_1

For the task of storing the recipe data, a Python dictionary is the most suitable data structure. The dictionary allows us to pair keys with their corresponding values in a structured way, which is ideal for representing objects with multiple attributes like recipes. In this case, recipe_1 is defined with keys for the recipe's name, cooking time, and a list of ingredients. This structure is both easy to access and modify, making it a practical choice for handling recipe data in Python programs. It supports direct access to any attribute and can be easily expanded or integrated with other data structures.

Step 2: Create a new list of all_recipes and add recipe_1 to the list

I chose a list for the all_recipes structure to manage multiple recipes because lists in Python allow for flexible, sequential storage of elements. This makes it easy to add, modify, and retrieve recipes as needed. Lists are also inherently ordered, which helps in maintaining the sequence of recipes as they are added, and their dynamic nature accommodates an expanding collection of recipe data efficiently.
